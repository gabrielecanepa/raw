## Assets

Static assets and resources available at [cdn.gabrielecanepa.com](https://cdn.gabrielecanepa.com).

Every asset is identified by a unique filename. Use this URL pattern to link to a resource:

```sh
https://static.gabrielecanepa.com/{filename}
```

To link to a specific version of a resource, add the commit hash to the URL: 

```sh
https://static.gabrielecanepa.com/{commit_hash}/{filename}
```

Examples:

- Static file<br>

- File with commit hash<br>
